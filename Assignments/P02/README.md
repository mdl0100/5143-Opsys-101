## Filesystem

### Overview
This project will implement a virtual database that uses Sqlite as its storage. This virtual file system will store all content in a single table like you see below. Our table will contain columns that represent the properties commonly found in a Linux long listing (e.g., ls -l). Here's an example table structure:

```CREATE TABLE FileSystem (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    pid INTEGER NOT NULL,
    filename TEXT NOT NULL,
    file_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    file_size INTEGER,
    owner TEXT NOT NULL,
    group TEXT NOT NULL,
    permissions TEXT NOT NULL,
    modification_time DATETIME,
    content BLOB
    hidden NUMBER 
);
```

Let's break down each column:

| Column Name         | Description                                                                                               |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`                | An auto-incrementing unique identifier for each file system entry.                                        |
| `pid`               | The id of the parent folder.                                                                              |
| `filename`          | The name of the file or directory.                                                                        |
| `file_type`         | A text field representing the type of the file (e.g., "file" or "directory").                             |
| `file_size`         | The size of the file in bytes. This can be `NULL` for directories.                                        |
| `owner`             | The owner of the file.                                                                                    |
| `group`             | The group associated with the file.                                                                       |
| `permissions`       | A text field representing the file permissions in the format "rwxr-xr-x" (example).                       |
| `modification_time` | The date and time when the file was last modified.                                                        |
| `content`           | A BLOB column where you can store the file's contents directly. This is suitable for small file contents. |
| `hidden`            | (Optional) Doesn't need to be a column as you could look for the dot in front of the filename. Up to you. |

## Requirements

The requirements to implement a filesystem could get extremely detailed and would involve several methods or functions to manage the various operations. Below is a list of **possible** methods. No we do not need to implement all of them, but I wanted to give you a taste of what a serious implementation might include. This is really a `File System API` or `class` that interacts with the underlying database to perform these operations.

### Example Query 

Below is an example query. It inserts a new row into some database. Notice the syntax with the ? marks as place holders for values.

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Define the values you want to insert
name = 'John'
age = 30

# Construct the SQL query with placeholders
sql_query = "INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES (?, ?)"

# Execute the query with the values
cursor.execute(sql_query, (name, age))

# Commit the changes and close the database connection
conn.commit()
conn.close()

```


1. **Create File**: Create a new file in a specified directory with the given name, owner, group, and permissions.
    ```python
    # Define the values for the new file
    pid = 1                                     # Parent directory ID 
    filename = 'new_file.txt'
    file_type = 'file'
    file_size = 1024                            # Actual file size in bytes
    owner = 'user1'                             # Owner's username
    group = 'users'                             # Group name
    permissions = 'rw-r-----'                   # Desired permissions
    modification_time = '2023-09-13 14:30:00 UTC'  # Modification time
    content = b'Binary data for new file'       # Actual binary content
    hidden = False                              # True or False

    # Insert the new file into the database
    cursor.execute("""
        INSERT INTO files (pid, filename, file_type, file_size, owner, group, permissions, modification_time, content, hidden)
        VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
    """, (pid, filename, file_type, file_size, owner, group, permissions, modification_time, content, hidden))

    ```
2. **Create Directory**: Create a new directory in a specified parent directory with the given name, owner, group, and permissions.

    ```python
    # Same as above
    ```

3. **Delete File**: Delete an existing file from the file system.

    ```python
    # Find the ID of the file you want to delete
    file_id = 3  

    # Construct the DELETE query
    delete_query = "DELETE FROM files WHERE id = ?"

    # Execute the DELETE query with the file ID as a parameter
    cursor.execute(delete_query, (file_id,))
    ```

4. **Delete Directory**: Delete an existing directory and its contents from the file system.

    ```python
    def delete_directory(directory_id):
        # Check if the directory exists
        cursor.execute("SELECT id FROM files WHERE id = ? AND file_type = 'directory'", (directory_id,))
        dir_exists = cursor.fetchone()

        if dir_exists:
            # List contents of the directory 
            cursor.execute("SELECT id, file_type FROM files WHERE pid = ?", (directory_id,))
            contents = cursor.fetchall()

            for content_id, content_type in contents:
                if content_type == 'file':
                    # Delete file
                    cursor.execute("DELETE FROM files WHERE id = ?", (content_id,))
                elif content_type == 'directory':
                    # Recursively delete subdirectory
                    delete_directory(content_id)

            # Delete the directory itself
            cursor.execute("DELETE FROM files WHERE id = ?", (directory_id,))
        else:
            print("Directory not found.")

    # Define the ID of the directory you want to delete
    directory_id = 2  

    # Call the delete_directory function to delete the directory and its contents
    delete_directory(directory_id)
    ```

5. **List Directory Contents**: List the contents (files and subdirectories) of a specified directory.
   
    ```python
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM files WHERE id = ?", (directory_id,))
    ```

6. **Read File**: Read the contents of an existing file.

    ```python
    cursor.execute("SELECT content FROM files WHERE id = ?", (directory_id,))
    ```

7. **Write File**: Write data to an existing file, potentially appending to the existing content.

8. **Move File or Directory**: Move a file or directory from one location to another within the file system.

9.  **Copy File or Directory**: Copy a file or directory to a new location within the file system.

10. **Change Ownership**: Change the owner of a file or directory.

11. **Change Group**: Change the group associated with a file or directory.

12. **Change Permissions**: Modify the permissions (e.g., read, write, execute) of a file or directory.

13. **Get File or Directory Information**: Retrieve metadata (e.g., size, modification time) about a file or directory.

14. **Search for Files**: Search for files or directories based on criteria like name, type, owner, or permissions.

15. **Access Control**: Implement access control checks to determine whether a user has permission to perform specific operations on files or directories.

16. **File Upload**: Upload a file from an external source (e.g., a client application) and store it in the file system.

17. **File Download**: Retrieve a file from the file system and provide it for download to an external client.

18. **File Versioning**: Implement version control for files to track changes and revisions.

19. **File Metadata Management**: Allow users to add and manage metadata (e.g., tags, descriptions) for files and directories.

20. **File and Directory Renaming**: Rename files and directories.

21. **Hidden Files and Directories Handling**: Implement functionality to hide or unhide files and directories based on naming conventions or attributes.

22. **File and Directory Permissions Enforcement**: Enforce access permissions to ensure that users can only perform actions allowed by their permissions.

23. **Error Handling and Logging**: Implement error handling to manage and log any exceptions or issues that arise during file system operations.

24. **File and Directory Locking**: Provide mechanisms to lock and unlock files and directories to prevent concurrent access conflicts.

25. **File and Directory Monitoring**: Implement mechanisms to monitor changes to files and directories (e.g., using inotify or similar technologies).

26. **File and Directory Permissions Inheritance**: Implement inheritance of permissions from parent directories to child directories and files.

27. **Trash or Recycle Bin**: Implement a feature to move deleted files and directories to a trash or recycle bin for potential recovery.



## Requirements 

### Those That Have Not Presented 

- If you haven't presented your shell yet and have opted to wait, then the [checklist](../P01/command_checklist.md) in `P02` applies to this assignment. 
- Meaning you will present just as all the others did, but using sqlite as a backend.

### Those That Have Presented 

- Here is a smaller checklist.
- You will not have to present per se. You will have to show a walkthrough

|    #    | Item                                             |  Value  | Earned |
| :-----: | ------------------------------------------------ | :-----: | :----: |
| ***1*** | ***Commands***                                   | **200** |        |
|    1    | *ls -lah*                                        |    ▢    |        |
|    2    | *mkdir bananas*                                  |    ▢    |        |
|    3    | *cd bananas*                                     |    ▢    |        |
|    4    | *cd ..*                                          |    ▢    |        |
|    5    | *pwd*                                            |    ▢    |        |
|    6    | *mv somefile.txt bananas*                        |    ▢    |        |
|    7    | *cp bananas/somefile.txt somefile/otherfile.txt* |    ▢    |        |
|    8    | *rm -rf bananas*                                 |    ▢    |        |
|    9    | *history*                                        |    ▢    |        |
|   10    | *chmod 777 somefile.txt*                         |    ▢    |        |

- You can simply run a file that shows an example `usage` of your file system.
- Example:

<img src="https://images2.imgbox.com/18/4e/iZzcjQcb_o.png">

- This should have a delay between commands so it can be seen running.
- Using python rich, you can have fun with it and format the output however you want, as long as you stay within the spirit of the command. 
- I've provided a mocked up example walkthrough [here](./walkthrough.py).
